What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

Answer: I believe the most important part is readability to be able for others and your future self to understand what was done with the code. If there is no comprehensibility, then there is a lack of further usefulness for themself or any others in the present of future. For myself, I would pay attention to comments and explanations of any and all variables and functions used because ambiguity is the opponent of clarity. While most coders can understand the implied meaning of their code, human memory fades and meaning can be lost. Comments in code clarify for human implication and error.

We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation?

Answer: The usefulness of computers helps to connect and understand the world. With the idea behind containers, many science experiments are the bubble or shield that holds any possible errors or mistakes without the threat of spreading it to an outside environment. If an experiment does go right, then containers that are reproducible are a great advantage for others to replicate and further develop the experiment beyond the initial findings. Containers, by definition, help to scientifically control the many variables to obtain the desired or experimental results. Containers, with further use, are a way to either isolate or connect in a meaningful way that helps to propel the use of technology forward.
